# Another Castle
Hey there, hello! Welcome to this repo where I keep all my dotfiles via [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

## Things that should be installed
For everything to behave nicely, the following needs to be installed
beforehand.

* [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
* [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)
* The fonts from the `fonts` folder in this repo
* [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
* [chruby](https://github.com/postmodern/chruby)
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
* [SCM Breeze](https://github.com/scmbreeze/scm_breeze)
* [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)
* [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) (Follow the installation instructions for Neovim)
* [starship](https://starship.rs/)

## Things to do after linking the castle
Once the castle is linked (as in, all dotfiles have been placed in the correct
location vic homesick) you'll want to install vim plugins by use of vim-plug.
Other than that, you should be good to go.
